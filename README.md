# Public Budget Analysis on Advertising Expenditures.

### What do we have here?

This repository contains information about advertising expenditure by state, county and city level  based on their respective budgets published by each administration budget's office. 

### About the data

All raw data used to create the dashboard visualizations presented here was downloaded from the respective websites for each State/City. Likewise, the links to the data files with the actual budget information are available under each city's category on this repository. 

That being said, **all charts and tables exclusively shows figures on __advertising expenditures__ for all department/cabinet of the State/City.**
